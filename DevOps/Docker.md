difference ===> 
- Operating systems required multiple dependencies and libraries to run, but in docker case we can not required multiple dependencies as reason this are lightweight.
- operating systems required seperated kernal for running, but in docker case it runs of host kernel means for running docker images we cannot required seperat kernel.
- only runtime libraries are installed thats why it cannot consume extra storage.
